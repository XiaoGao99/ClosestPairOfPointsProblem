# ClosestPairOfPointsProblem
Program Assignment 2 for CSS449 Algorithm Design and Analysis

## Description
- Apply devide and conquer algorithm to find the closest pair of points in a given dataset.
- Output the distance between the closest pair of points in every recursive call.

## File Format
- Must be named `program2data.txt`
- Input file will consist of n points, with n specified on the first line, and n additional lines containing the x- and y-coordinates, which will be real numbers (not integers).
- Use `program2data.txt` in this repo as reference.

## Example output
- `D[0,1]: 34.2222`
- The indices are after sorting by x-coordinate and the distances include all points in between the two indices

## Note
- Distance are with four digits of precision.
- Written in Java
